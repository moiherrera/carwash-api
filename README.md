Carwash is a home-car-wash service. The idea was formulated by a client. This software package allow
customers to provide their address, available times, phone number, name and car information. The client
can then use an administrator authentication to access the data that all of their customers provide. They will
then use this data to plan out the schedule they must create to deliver their service to customers in the most
profit-maximizing and efficient way possible.
